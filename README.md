# Breast Cancer Classification using Machine Learning

This program aims to build and evaluate machine learning models for breast cancer classification using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this program is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It consists of various features computed from breast mass images and a target variable indicating the diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign).

The dataset can be accessed from the following link:

## Models
Two machine learning models are built using different algorithms to classify breast cancer cases:

1. Model 1: Logistic Regression
   - Algorithm: Logistic Regression
   - Python Script: `<yourname>_model_v1.py`

2. Model 2: Decision Tree Classifier
   - Algorithm: Decision Tree Classifier
   - Python Script: `<yourname>_model_v2.py`

## Instructions
To run the program and train the models, follow these steps:
1. Install the necessary dependencies (pandas, scikit-learn, etc.).
2. Download the dataset from the provided link or update the dataset path in the code.
3. Run `Mohammad Noman Kazi_Model_v1.py` to train and evaluate Model 1.
4. Run `Mohammad Noman Kazi_model_v2.py` to train and evaluate Model 2.

## Results
The accuracy of each model is calculated and printed at the end of the script execution.
